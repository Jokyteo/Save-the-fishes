# Save-the-black-rhinos
Inspired by MrBeast's teamtrees project.

MrBeast's teamtrees project aimed to plant 20 million trees through donations of a dollar per tree. At the time of writing, 22,352,616 trees have been planted from this project. I find this a very meaningful project that can help to make up for some of the trees that we have chopped down and the trees burned down due to wildfires. We have done our part to save trees, so we would now need to do our part to save animals.

Black rhinos are one of the most endangered species in the world. According to the WWF, black rhinos is a 'Critically endangered' species. Here are some statistics. Between 1960 and 1995, black rhino numbers have dropped by 98%, to less than 2,500. This was due to European hunters and settlers who hunted the black rhinos as a form of a game called trophy hunting where payment is involved for a hunting experience and consumers get to keep a body part such as antlers or horns as trophies. Since then, there have been many efforts made which helped to increase the numbers to 5600. However, the rhinos are still considered endangered. In addition, rhino conservation is rather expensive and there are huge pressures to provide enough land and security measures. Parks and programmes that allow trophy hunting can use the funds generated to protect their rhino populations as a whole. 

In conclusion, we should create a website just like MrBeast did and ask the public to donate a small amount of money to repopulate the rhinos.
