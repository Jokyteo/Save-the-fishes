# Save-the-fishes
Inspired by MrBeast's teamtrees project.

MrBeast's teamtrees project aimed to plant 20 million trees through donations of a dollar per tree. At the time of writing, 22,352,616 trees have been planted from this project. I find this a very meaningful project that can help to make up for some of the trees that we have chopped down and the trees burned down due to wildfires. 

However, our fish supply has been going down very sharply
